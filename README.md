# snake-game
## Description:
A classic console snake game. 
- The player controls a snake that crawls along a plane bounded by walls, collecting food, avoiding collisions with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. 
- Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it becomes longer, which gradually complicates the game.
- The player cannot stop the movement of the snake. 
- The player's points are displayed next to the field. 
- If the player loses, he can start the game over.
## Controls:
The player controls the head of the snake with the following commands:
 - up    - W key
 - down  - S key
 - right - D key
 - left  - A key
The snake's tail follows the trajectory of its head.
